# Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project
In this case study, I work for a
fictional company, Cyclistic, along with some key team members. In order to answer the
business questions, follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process,
Analyze, Share, and Act. 

# Senario
I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share
company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success
depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to
understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these
insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual
members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be
backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

In this capstone project we follow the following steps and recor in Rstudio in the Rdiviy codes file.

The data analysis project steps are:
1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. process
4. Analyze
5. Share
6. Act


Ask:
In this step, Moreno has assigned me the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

By following this step, will produce a report with clear statement of business task and description of all data sources used. And summary of analysis, documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data.

Prepare:
In this step, Use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends.  This is public data that you can use to explore
how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes.

Process:
In this step, process of your data analysis which is clrearly displayed in the R scripts file.

Analyze:
Now that your data is stored appropriately and has been prepared for analysis, start putting it
to work.

Share:
In this step, we create data visulizations to share your findings. These visualizations are created based on the analysis of the data which is saved as Rplot and Rplot1 image files in the root directory.

Act:
Based on the analysis and visualizations, the number of rides per weekday for member and casual subcribers shows that the members use the rides high every day of the week. And also, the avergae duration per weekday for member and casual subcribers shows that the casual subcribers have very high ride duration. Thus this answers the Morenos business question has been answered. Thus based on the analysis, we can recommend that the process to increase the member subcribtions.
