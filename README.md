# Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project
In this case study, I work for a
fictional company, Cyclistic, along with some key team members. In order to answer the
business questions, follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process,
Analyze, Share, and Act. 

# Senario
I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share
company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success
depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to
understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these
insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual
members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be
backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

In this capstone project we follow the following steps and recor in Rstudio in the Rdiviy codes file.

The data analysis project steps are:
1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. process
4. Analyze
5. Share
6. Act
